- 👋 Hi, I’m @JimBLogic
- 👀 I’m interested in Bitcoin, computer gaming, sports (Parkour, Crossfit, gymnastics, badminton...), podcasts and reading.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git and hopefully a bit of Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can be helpful at bitcoin related.
- 📫 How to reach me: on #Nostr : npub1fwqls8xme2xcday6dallek76l23w60a28qvwpa85q9phk9g27rgstfncap
